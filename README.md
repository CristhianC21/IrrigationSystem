# Smart Irrigation System

This repository is part of the final project of Advanced diploma studies in Software development.
During 5 five weeks, I came up with a project solution using embedeed systems, python and sensors. 

Full project information is available via https://siscristhiancanon.wordpress.com/. It includes weekly updates of the project sharing videos of sensor's operation, components used, circuit diagrams.

The project was selected to be part of national science fair in Malta. 

## Overview
The Smart Irrigation System is a project solution that aims to facilitate small farmers to water the plants automatically based on the moisture of soil, ambient temperature, rain probability, and using a photoresistor for water plants during the night and therefore saving water resources by showing every sensor percentage in LCD. This project will improve farmersâ€™ work time used to this labour.
